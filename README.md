# PsyControl_Game
A small game made with a classmate (Nick Linton) created in Unity using C#. We treated it like a game jam and gave ourselves a 48 hour time limit.

To run, extract the .zip file.
Then run PsyControl.exe in the Build folder.

This is just the build to play the game.
Due to size contraints on here, I was not able to upload the entire project.
If you want the project files, email me at vencillv@gmail.com and I'll gladly share the project with you.
